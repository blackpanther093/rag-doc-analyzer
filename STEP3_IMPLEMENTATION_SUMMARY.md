### **Sample Enhanced Queries**

**Complete Query:**
```
"46-year-old male, knee surgery in Pune, 3-month-old insurance policy"
→ Extracts: age=46, gender=M, procedure=knee surgery, location=Pune, policy_duration=3 months
→ Expands: knee replacement, arthroplasty, knee procedure
→ Validates: ✅ Valid, high confidence
→ Reasons: demographic_eligibility, procedure_coverage, policy_analysis
```

**Vague Query:**
```
"surgery"
→ Extracts: procedure=surgery
→ Disambiguates: "Vague procedure: 'surgery' could refer to multiple types"
→ Suggests: "Please specify the type of surgery (e.g., knee surgery, heart surgery)"
→ Validates: ⚠️ Missing required information
```

**Complex Query:**
```
"70-year-old female with diabetes, emergency heart bypass surgery in Mumbai, premium coverage"
→ Extracts: age=70, gender=F, medical_condition=diabetes, urgency=high, procedure=heart bypass, location=Mumbai, coverage_type=premium
