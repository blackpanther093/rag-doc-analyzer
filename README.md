# rag-doc-analyzer

A robust Document Q&A Assistant that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to process natural language queries and retrieve relevant information from large unstructured documents such as policy documents, contracts, and emails.

## üöÄ Features

### Document Processing
- **PDF Files**: Full text extraction with PyPDF2 and PyMuPDF fallback
- **Word Documents**: Support for .docx and .doc files
- **Email Files**: Processing of .eml and .msg files
- **Text Files**: Plain text file support
- **Images**: OCR support for PNG, JPG, JPEG files
- **Multi-format**: Process multiple file types simultaneously

### Query Processing
- **Natural Language**: Handle vague, incomplete, or plain English queries
- **Enhanced Parsing**: Extract age, gender, procedure, location, policy duration, medical conditions, urgency
- **Query Validation**: Validate queries and provide suggestions for improvement
- **Semantic Expansion**: Expand queries with synonyms and related terms for better retrieval
- **Query Disambiguation**: Resolve ambiguities and provide clarifications
- **Multi-Hop Reasoning**: Chain multiple reasoning steps for comprehensive analysis
- **Semantic Search**: Use vector embeddings for intelligent document retrieval
- **Decision Extraction**: Automatically extract approval/rejection status and amounts

### Output & Analysis
- **Structured JSON**: Consistent, interpretable responses with clause mapping
- **Evidence Mapping**: Link decisions to specific document clauses with relevance scoring
- **Clause Extraction**: Automatic identification of policy sections and decision impacts
- **Decision Confidence**: Calculate confidence scores based on evidence strength
- **Audit Trail**: Track decision factors and reasoning
- **Multi-tab Interface**: Answer, Decision Summary, and Debug views with JSON output
